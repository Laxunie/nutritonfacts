# Project Website: https://nutritionfactsapi.onrender.com/

#### The purpose of this project was to practice ReactJS and API fetching with Axios

#### This website uses the CalorieNinja API found on RapidAPI. This API has the nutrition facts of thousands of foods and drinks, go to the website search for any food/beverage and it will give you its nutrition facts.

### Familiarized myself with:
* ReactJS Hooks (State/Effect)
* Asynchronous API calls (async/await)
* JSX, Events, TailWindCSS
